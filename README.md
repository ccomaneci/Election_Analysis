# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit
In this challenge we learned how to write code in Python. To do this, we obtained a long list of election data that was provided to us in an excel file, that file contained 369712 lines of data[1]. That information supplied the name of the candidates running, the number of votes they received and the county the votes were placed in. That is a lot of data to try to break down manually and certainly cause room for errors to be made. However, with the use of Python we could right code that would allow us to determine the total number of votes received during the campaign, how many of those votes went to each candidate and what county the vote was placed in. 

## Election-Audit Results
From this we learned that there was a total of 369,711 votes placed during this election. And we calculated how many of those votes went to each of the 3 candidates: Charles Casper Stockham with 85,213 votes, Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes and Raymon Anthony Doane 11,606 votes[2]. That data was further broken down to tell us how many votes came from each county and the percentage of those votes for both the county and candidate counts. DeGette received 73.8% of the total votes, while Stockham received 23% and Doane received 3.1%, this helped us determine Diana DeGette as the winner of the election. Using Python we could even determine the voting participation of the people. Denver county had 82.8%, 306,055 of the overall votes while, Jefferson county received 10.5% 38,855 and Arapahoe had 6.7%, 24,801 votes. This helped us establish Denver county as having the most voter participation[2].

## Election-Audit Summary
Doing this project showed us how useful it is to learn how to write code using Python. It showed us how to take a magnitude of information, pull from it what we want to know and make it easy to read. This could be helpful not just with this project but processing and reading other election results as well. For instance, letâ€™s say this was a national election and we had to total up the results of and election for states and not just county? We could change the formula from using county votes and winning county to state votes and winning state[2].
